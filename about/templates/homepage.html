      <p>Iâ€™m a highly motivated and competent full stack developer, who 
        enjoys working with Open Source technologies to build responsive 
        and scalable web applications.</p>
      <p>For the last two years I've worked for 
        <a href="http://www.cgi.com/en">CGI</a>, where I have contributed 
        to their application management platform which we deliver as a SaaS. 
        This has included ownership of solution design, significant 
        development work with Python and end user engagement to improve
        usability. Outside of my project work I've helped to distribute 
        technical knowledge across the UK business, and attended industry 
        specific conferences such as PyConUK.</p>
      <p>In my own time I've built a number of websites, using 
        a range of both established and bleeding edge technologies. This 
        includes <a href="https://github.com/dannymilsom/stronger">
        Stronger</a>, a workout tracking tool built using 
        <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>; and 
        <a href="https://github.com/dannymilsom/distributed-poker">
        Distributed Poker</a>, a real time planning poker poker app built 
        using <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> (a demo is hosted on 
        <a href="http://distributed-poker.herokuapp.com/heroku"> Heroku</a>).
        Away from the computer I enjoy playing football, walking the family 
        dog and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/inthecity123"> pretending 
        to be a DJ</a>.</p>

        <span class="lead text-center">Server Side</span>
        <p class="skill-text">I'm fluent in object oriented, idiomatic 
          <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>; but have also used 
          <a href="https://java.com/en/">Java</a> and 
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">
          JavaScript</a> as server side languages. Most of my commercial 
          experience has been working with a LAPP stack, which has helped me 
          grow my expertise in a range of development envioronments 
          (<a href="http://www.redhat.com/products/enterprise-linux/">Red Hat 
          Enterprise Linux</a> / <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>) 
          and relational databases (<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">
          PostgreSQL</a> / <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>). I'm 
          also interested in the flexibility of NoSQL, after some 
          exposure to <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a>.</p>

        <span class="lead text-center">Client Side</span>
        <p class="skill-text">I have a strong working knowledge of HTML, CSS 
          and JavaScript; and have used these skills to build responsive, 
          mobile friendly and intuitive user interfaces. In addition to these 
          core scripting languages, I often use <a href="http://jquery.com/">
          jQuery</a> to mitigate browser compatability issues, CSS 
          pre-processors such as <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> to 
          make my style sheets more maintainable, and modern JavaScript 
          frameworks such as <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone JS</a> 
          to create richer user experiences.</p>

        <span class="lead text-center">Frameworks</span>
        <p class="skill-text">I have a solid understanding and many years 
          experience using the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">
          Django</a> web framework, having built a number of websites 
          using this technology. I have also written numerous plugins 
          and macros to extend the functionality of the 
          <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac framework</a> during my 
          time at CGI, and utilised <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/"> 
          Twitter Bootstrap</a> both in professional capacity, and in my 
          own side projects.</p>

        <span class="lead text-center">Tools</span>
        <p class="skill-text">I use DVCS such as <a href="http://git-scm.com/">
          Git</a> and more traditional VCS such as 
          <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/"> Subversion</a> on a daily 
          basis as part of my workflow, utilising the power of branching and 
          merging to support parallel development. Working in an agile team 
          I've also used configuration management tools such as 
          <a href="http://www.ansible.com/home">Ansible</a> and continuous 
          integration tools such as <a href"http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> 
          to reduce the burden of manual system administration and improve 
          the quality of deliverable software.</p>
